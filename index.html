    The Nile (Arabic: النيل‎, written as al-Nīl; pronounced as an-Nīl[needs Arabic IPA]) is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa, and is the longest river in Africa and the disputed longest river in the world,[2][3] as the Brazilian government says that the Amazon River is longer than the Nile.[4][5] The Nile, which is about 6,650 km (4,130 mi)[n 1] long, is an "international" river as its drainage basin covers eleven countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt.[7] In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan.[

    The Nile has two major tributaries – the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is considered to be the headwaters and primary stream of the Nile itself. The Blue Nile, however, is the source of most of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi.v
